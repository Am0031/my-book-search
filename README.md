## Technologies

The key technologies and packages used here are:

- Node
- Frontend: Apollo client, React JS with react-dom, react-scripts, react-router-dom, Bootstrap with react-bootstrap, GraphQL, jwt-decode
- Backend: Apollo server, Express with apollo-server-express, GraphQL, Mongoose, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt
- Dev: nodemon

## Refactoring steps

In order to go from a RESTful setup to a GraphQL setup, the following changes took place:

- Frontend:

  - in App.js: added an apollo server
  - in a new "graphql" folder: added mutations and queries for communication with backend
  - in SignupForm.js, LoginForm.js and SearchBooks.js: replaced calls to the functions in the "API" file by useMutation calls
  - in SavedBooks: replaced the useEffect for userData, by the useQuery call, and replaced calls to the functions in the "API" file by useMutation calls

- Backend:
  - in Server.js: added an apollo server which uses the express server as middleware
  - in auth.js: updated function to work with graphql
  - in a new "Schemas" folder: added typeDefs in index.js
    in a new "Resolvers" folder: added resolver functions with correct syntax for apollo server and mongoose models
  - removed routes and controllers folders at the end
